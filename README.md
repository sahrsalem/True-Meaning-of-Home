# True Meaning of Home

## 🌟 Concept
The true meaning of a home is not found in furniture or walls,  
but in the spirit that gives life to it.  
This project was designed as an advertisement concept, aiming to show that we create life and warmth before furniture.  
It reflects the emotional essence of living spaces — comfort, belonging, and beauty.

## 🎨 Visual Identity
- **Video in Hero Section**: immersive and symbolic  
- **Dark & light contrasts**: balance and clarity

  Instead, it uses carefully chosen images and crafted content to describe the warmth and love found in every corner of a home.  
  The design focuses on atmosphere and emotion rather than furniture or decoration alone.
